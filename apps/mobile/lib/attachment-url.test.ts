/**
 * Pure-function tests for the mobile attachment URL resolver. The with-base
 * form covers every branch; the runtime form proves relative URLs follow the
 * server selected on the login screen.
 *
 * Coverage target: every branch the call sites in the app rely on —
 *   - `comment-attachment-list.tsx`         → file chip Linking.openURL
 *   - `markdown-image.tsx`                  → mc:// + RN image loader
 *   - `composer-attachment-row.tsx`         → completed non-image chip
 *                                             tap → Linking.openURL
